# BUBBLE SORT

Bubble sort is the Beginners Sorting Algorithm because it is mostly used by the Beginners for sorting. Although this is not the best Algorithm for sorting as is Complexity is O(n^2). As we know that O(n^2) is not good for our solution to some simpler problems. So some Professional Programmers avoid using this sort. Moreover the the book "Introduction to ALgorithm" by Cormen doesn't have this Algorithm. Basically this sort gets its name from its technique to sort i.e bubble shape.
